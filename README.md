# CRUD-AJAX
Code with solution branch at: https://github.com/helloRupa/js-crud

## By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
Perform all of the CRUD actions using fetch() and update the DOM with that data

## Buy why?
Being able to create, read, update, and destroy data from the frontend allows users to interact with websites and persist their changes. Imagine going to Facebook, you make a post, you see the post on the page, but then you refresh and your post is gone (not because you posted something naughty, but because the HTTP request was never made). Not a great experience, eh!

## How we'll get there:
- [ ] Create `fetch` requests (including `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) (We have already done GET)
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with `fetch` calls
- [ ] Understand optimistic vs pessimistic rendering
    - Updating UI/DOM

### Deliverables (User Stories)
As a user, I can:
- [x] See all the cat gifs and their comments
- [ ] Create a new cat gif post (image with comment)
- [ ] Delete a cat gif post
- [ ] Edit a comment for a post already on the page

All changes should _persist_ in our database.
